example code

main.c
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
        int y = 10;
        int x = 12 + y;
        printf("result is %i \n", x);   
}
```
output:
```
result is 22
```

use Makefile to compile it
outputs main.o (executable binary) and main.s (assembly)

generate a binary given an assembly
1) generate object files
```
as main.s -o obj_file.o
```
2) link the object files
```
gcc -m64 obj_file.o -o exe
```

This should work for `main.s` as generated by gcc, as well
as the instrumented binaries generated by RetroWrite

These steps can also be combined -- and apparently gcc does not work

to compile output generated by retrowrite into an executable do
```
clang -m64 retro_output -o output_name 
```
