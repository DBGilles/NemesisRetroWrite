From the readme:
SGX-Step is an open-source framework to facilitate side-channel attack research
on Intel x86 processors in general and Intel SGX platforms in particular

They provide a seperate readme that specifies building for 32-bit versions.

In the Nemesis paper they run SGX-step on a 64 bit processor.
