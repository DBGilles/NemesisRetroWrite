abstract = {Information leakage through side-channels poses a serious threat to the security of distributed systems. Recent research on countermeasures against side-channel attacks show that, on embedded platforms with predictable execution times, certain classes of these vulnerabilities can be detected and mitigated automatically by means of language-based security techniques. In this paper, we propose a security type system to statically analyse MSP430 assembly programs to detecting information leakage through novel interrupt-latency attacks (a.k.a. Nemesis), timing side-channels, and undesired information flow. We have implemented our technique in a tool, Side Channel FinderMSP, which automatically verifies MSP430 object-code programs to be free of such vulnerabilities. We evaluate the effectiveness of our tool by applying it to a representative set of vulnerable and benign programs. Our experiments demonstrate that the tool is both effective in detecting vulnerabilities, and scalable to realistic applications.},

abstract = {Recent research on transient execution vulnerabilities shows that current processors exceed our levels of understanding. The prominent Meltdown and Spectre attacks abruptly revealed fundamental design flaws in CPU pipeline behavior and exception handling logic, urging the research community to systematically study attack surface from microarchitectural interactions. We present Nemesis, a previously overlooked side-channel attack vector that abuses the CPU's interrupt mechanism to leak microarchitectural instruction timings from enclaved execution environments such as Intel SGX, Sancus, and TrustLite. At its core, Nemesis abuses the same subtle microarchitectural behavior that enables Meltdown, i.e., exceptions and interrupts are delayed until instruction retirement. We show that by measuring the latency of a carefully timed interrupt, an attacker controlling the system software is able to infer instruction-granular execution state from hardware-enforced enclaves. In contrast to speculative execution vulnerabilities, our novel attack vector is applicable to the whole computing spectrum, from small embedded sensor nodes to high-end commodity x86 hardware. We present practical interrupt timing attacks against the open-source Sancus embedded research processor, and we show that interrupt latency reveals microarchitectural instruction timings from off-the-shelf Intel SGX enclaves. Finally, we discuss challenges for mitigating Nemesis-type attacks at the hardware and software levels.},
