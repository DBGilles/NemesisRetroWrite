[X] finish first version evaluation script -- initial version completed -- works only for single function
[X] fix code so that it works for any/all functions in a program
[X] support for function calls (?)
[X]  figure out when/where cycles should be removed/replaced etc.
[X] clean up code -- ook zeker file structure, notebooks etc.
5.  insert push and pop before/after instruction (at all nodes in level)
6.  improve design section writing + implementation section
    - something about function calls
    - something about graph needing to be acyclic (or the subgraph at least) or not being able to support loops or something ... (and explain why in a good way)
7.  finish evaluation, create set of test programs, run evaluation etc.
8.  Clean up (Abstract)NemesisNode
